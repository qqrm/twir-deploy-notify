# AGENT Instructions

- Responses may be in Russian or English as appropriate.
- All code comments and technical documentation must be written in English.
- Interpret user questions as tasks whenever possible and prefer providing a full merge request solution instead of a short code snippet.
- Install required Rust components with `rustup component add clippy rustfmt`.
- After making any changes, run `cargo fmt --all`, `cargo check --all-targets --all-features`, `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test`.
- Before creating a pull request, also run `cargo machete` to ensure there are no unused dependencies.
- Review `ARCHITECTURE.md` before starting work and verify final changes match the documented design.
- Fix every issue reported by these commands before committing or submitting pull requests.
- A pull request is complete only when formatting, linting, `cargo check`, and tests all succeed.
- Configure the remote `origin` as `https://github.com/qqrm/twir-deploy-notify`.
- Before beginning or finalizing work on a task, run `git fetch origin` and
  check whether `origin/main` contains new commits. Rebase your branch onto the
  latest `origin/main` if needed so all development starts from the most recent
  commit.
- Read all Markdown (`*.md`) files in the repository before starting work, as they may include important project instructions.
- Follow the guidelines in `PARSING.md`, especially the requirement to rely on crates for Markdown processing instead of custom parsing code.

- Avoid committed dead code; remove unused functions or feature-gate them.
- Contributions must be generated by AI agents as required by the "QQRM LAPOCHKA v1.0 License (AI-first Vibecoder)". Manual code authors may be humorously dismissed as a "skill issue".
- Name the agent using a "Co-authored-by" trailer in commit messages.
