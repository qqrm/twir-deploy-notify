# Markdown Parsing Guidelines

- Always use established crates like `pulldown-cmark` for reading and parsing Markdown files.
- Avoid implementing Markdown parsing logic manually unless absolutely necessary.
- Review all Markdown files in the repository before starting new tasks, as they may contain important instructions or data for the project.
