**Quote of the Week:** üí¨
\> I love Rust, so I was already biased to be positive about the Rust for Linux project, even before dabbling with it myself\. I'm genuinely surprised to be even more optimistic now than before\. The coding part was much easier than I imagined, thanks to the use of reference counting in the kernel\.
And the promised benefits of Rust over C? They're absolutely real\. The Rust version of the driver feels way more robust than the C code, not just regarding memory safety\. It didn't have a single bug: Once it compiled, it worked\. That's not a huge deal considering it was a direct rewrite, but it counts for something\.

Despite a lamentable lack of suggestions, llogiq is reasonably pleased with his choice\.
